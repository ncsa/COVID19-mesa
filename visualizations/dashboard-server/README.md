## Set up

Install a local redis server following the instruction here: https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/, and start a redis server locally.

Install Postman: https://www.postman.com/downloads. 

Import `mesa.postman_collection.json` as a collection onto Postman by clicking the `Import` button on the top of the side panel.

Create a `/data` folder under this directory `/dashboard-server` and put the files generated by `pull_data.ipynb` under `/data-generation-scripts`.

Run the flask server specified in `app.py` in dev mode:
```bash
flask --debug run
```

Open the `GET load` tab under mesa collection in Postman. Execute a GET request to `/load?filename=...`  load the ensemble files one by one under `/data` into redis.
